In PyBank project we will present a script that analyzes the financial records of a dummy company. 
The data set is provided in a separate folder named as "Resources" which is a csv file and contains two columns, Date and Profit/Losses.

The data presents the profit (postive values) or losses (negative values) on a date.

The output of the script includes the following:
    - The total number of months included in the dataset
    - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
    - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The output will also be written in .txt file names as analysis.txt in the analysis folder.
