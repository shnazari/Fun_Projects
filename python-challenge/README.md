# Python Challenge

In this Python challenge we will analyze two provided data sets for two separate projects, PyBank and PyPoll:

## PyBank
In PyBank project we will present a script that analyzes the financial records of a dummy company. 
The data set is provided in a separate folder named as "Resources" which is a csv file and contains two columns, Date and Profit/Losses.

The data presents the profit (postive values) or losses (negative values) on a date.

The output of the script includes the following:
    - The total number of months included in the dataset
    - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
    - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The output will also be written in .txt file names as analysis.txt in the analysis folder.

## PyPoll
In PyPoll project a set of poll data called election_data.csv is given in the Resources directory. 

The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

There is Python script in this project's directory that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
    - The total number of votes cast
    - A complete list of candidates who received votes
    - The percentage of votes each candidate won
    - The total number of votes each candidate won
    - The winner of the election based on popular vote
    
The out pull will both be written in the terminal and will be saved in "analysis\analysis.txt"
