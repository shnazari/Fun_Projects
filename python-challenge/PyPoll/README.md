In PyPoll project a set of poll data called election_data.csv is given in the Resources directory. 

The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

There is Python script in this project's directory that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
    - The total number of votes cast
    - A complete list of candidates who received votes
    - The percentage of votes each candidate won
    - The total number of votes each candidate won
    - The winner of the election based on popular vote
    
The out pull will both be written in the terminal and will be saved in "analysis\analysis.txt"
