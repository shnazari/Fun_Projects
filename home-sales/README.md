# Overview

In this project we will use SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then we'll use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

## Objectives
By the end of this project we will be able to answer following questions:

	* What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year?
	* What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms?
	* What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet?
	* What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000?
