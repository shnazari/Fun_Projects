### Background

In this deliverable, we have created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. We have used the 'citipy Python library' (linked bellow), and the 'OpenWeatherMap API' to create a representative model of weather across cities.

In part one and in WeatherPy.ipynb notebook, we have generated random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination.

In part 2, and in Vacationpy.ipynb notebook, we have used the weather data generated in part 1 to plan future vacations.
